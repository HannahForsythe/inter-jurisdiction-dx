DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLDER STRUCTURE of this project. The analysis scripts
will not run. 

DO NOT DELETE crosswalk files in the 'input' subfolder: 
  -crosswalk_132321.csv maps CVX codes to corresponding antigen and number of 
    required doses in the adolescent series.
  -crosswalk_4313314.csv maps CVX codes to corresponding antigen(s) and number 
    of required doses in the childhood 7-series.
  -crosswalk_COVID.csv maps CVX codes to vaccine type (J&J, Pfizer, Bivalent 
    Booster, etc.) for evaluating the COVID series.
  -crosswalk_flu.csv identifies CVX codes that are flu shots.
  -crosswalk_CVX_nm.csv contains all CVX codes currently accepted, plus names
  -mcir_fips_national_county.csv lists all valid county and state FIPS codes in 
    the US. Data source: MCIR (Michigan Care Improvement Registry).
    
DO NOT CHANGE the definition of any functions in helper_functions.R The analysis 
scripts will not run as intended.

DO NOT DELETE files from the subfolder "input/census". These Bridged-Race 
  population estimates from the National Vital Statistics office (available: 
  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race/data_documentation.htm) are used to
  generate denominators for ages 18+, from 2010 to 2020 (2010 and 2020 data
  reused for any years outside that range). To reduce file size, YOU MAY DELETE
  files corresponding to years when data exchange did not occur in your 
  jurisdiction.  
  
  [  If you wish to provide your own adult population estimates, create a file
    "input/denom.csv" that contains the total population of every 
    county x age x sex x race_1 group in your jurisdiction, for every 
    year since data exchange began.
	  See specs/Example_minimum_dataset-[DATE].xlsx for definitions and examples.	
	  YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REWRITING ANY CODE that generates denominators,
	  including but not limited to: 
	  - 3_covid_cvg.R Section 1. "create denominator"
	  - 9_flu_cvg.R Section 1. "create denominator"                              ]


## Before you begin ##
1. Install the following R packages: 
  tidyverse
  readxl
  lubridate
  janitor
  zoo
  gt
  gtsummary
  flextable
  cowplot

2. Open 0a_parameters.R and set the paramaters for your jurisdiction.

3. Prepare your data and save it in the 'input' subfolder:
  - immz.zip
	A shot-level dataset including the FULL immunization history of every 
	person with at least one shared shot.
	See specs/Example_minimum_dataset-[DATE].xlsx for definitions and examples.	
	See input/immz_dummy.zip for a more realistic example.
  - demog.zip
	A person-level dataset including every non-deceased client in the native IIS,
	regardless of residence or shot history.
	See specs/Example_minimum_dataset-[DATE].xlsx for definitions and examples.	
	See input/demog_dummy.zip for a more realistic example.


4. Execute 0b_data_checks.R This will check your data for conditions like:
  -every person in immz.csv is present in demog.csv
  -birth dates are before admin dates
  -columns are correctly named
  -fields all have valid values
  -etc.
 
5. REMOVE any records that fail to meet all 15 conditions. 

## Instructions for running the analyses ##
0. Set the working directory to the source file location. (In R studio, select 
  Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location)

1. Each analysis script is designed to run independently of the others, meaning
that you should be able to run each one in a NEW R session:  
  - 1_immz_analysis.R
  - 2_person_analysis.R
  - 3_COVID_cvg.R
  - 4_4313314_cvg.R
  - 5_MMR_cvg.R -> just a placeholder for now
  - 6_DTaP_cvg.R -> just a placeholder for now
  - 7_132321_cvg.R
  - 8_Tdap_cvg.R -> just a placeholder for now
  - 9_Flu_cvg.R

2. If you wish to run analyses 1-9 in the SAME session, you can skip these two
lines:

    immz <- read_delim("input/immz.zip") %>%
      janitor::clean_names() %>% 
      mutate(report_yr = year(report_date))
    
    demog <- read_delim("input/demog.zip") %>%
      janitor::clean_names() 


3. To create summary figures, run 10_cvg_figs.R; if run in the SAME session as 
  the analyses, you can skip Section  0 "read in the raw data". Othewise, 
  you must re-read in the data that was exported to "~/output/3_coverage/" by 
  analyses 3-9. Provide the appropriate name and date for each csv file.
